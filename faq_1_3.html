<br>Ans.    No, the nomination of a candidate cannot be rejected for suppressing or giving false information in the affidavit. The copies of the nomination papers filed by each candidate along with copy of the affidavit accompanying the nomination should be displayed on the notice board in the office of RO on the day the nomination is filed. If anyone furnishes any information contradicting the statements in the nomination form or affidavits by means of a duly sworn affidavit, copies of such affidavits should also be displayed on the notice board. If the RO is satisfied that  the information given by the candidate in the affidavit is wrong he is required to file a formal complaint before the appropriate Court under section 125A of the R.P. Act, 1951 and Section 177 of IPC (read with section 200 CrPC).
<br><br>Ques. 3. If a complaint is received that a person who has filed nomination is of  unsound mind, what course of action will be taken by RO?
<br>Ans.    The complainant has to prove by producing a declaration by the competent court under the Lunacy Act to the affect that the person concerned is of unsound mind. Disqualification is attracted only when there is a declaration by competent court.
 
<br><br>Ques. 4. What if 5 or more than 5 persons, who are proposers, happen to be illiterate & their thumb impressions are to be attested, can we allow more than 5 persons in the RO room in that case?
<br>Ans.    Thumb impressions on the nomination paper has to be attested for which thumb impressions have to be put before the RO or before an Administrative Officer not below the rank of SDO. To enable the proposers to put their thumb impressions before RO, they shall be called by the RO in batches of four for putting the thumb impression in his presence.

<br><br>Ques. 6. If the affidavit of a candidate is objected to, and RO feels that it has some substance, does the RO himself initiate proceedings under RP Act or IPC or should objector do it?
<br>Ans.    Yes, the RO has to initiate proceeding under the relevant statutory provisions. (Pl. see Ans. To Q. No. 2)
<br><br>Ques. 7. For an independent candidate 10 proposers are required to sign the nomination paper before RO. If during scrutiny one proposer says it was not signed by him, what will RO do?
<br>Ans.    The RO shall ask the person concerned to submit an affidavit to this affect. If affidavit is submitted then RO shall make a summary inquiry to satisfy himself as to the authenticity of the signature of the proposer. The candidate shall be given adequatae opportunity to present his case. In case it is proved that the signature was forged, the nomination of the candidate will be rejected since the nomination with 9 proposers cannot be accepted as a valid nomination paper as per law in the case of candidates sponsored by registered unrecognized party and independent candidates.
<br><br>Ques. 8. Whether nomination papers of a candidate who was physically present just a minute before 3:00 PM on the last day of nomination, but without documents will be received or not?
<br>Ans.    Nomination paper if available with the candidate has to be received but no other document shall be permitted to be brought into his office after
3.00 PM. In the check list, the fact of not having submitted the relevant documents will be entered. Question of rejection of nomination paper will be decided at he time of scrutiny.
<br><br>Ques. 9.    What is the time limit for filing Form 6, to include name in electoral rolls in case applicant wants to be candidate also.

However, Form-6 filed thereafter upto the last date for filing nomination shall be received by the ERO but orders can be passed on each such Form only after completion of the election. Under the law, no order for inclusion of name in electoral roll can be made after the last date for making nomination. There are Court ruling clarifying that the cut-off time for passing orders in this regard would be 3.00 PM on the last day of filing of nomination. There are other statutory requirement of displaying the applications on the notice board by the ERO for 7 days, etc. before the ERO can pass orders on the claim application.
<br><br>Ques. 10.    What document should be taken as proof of citizenship?
<br>Ans.    There is no specific document to prove the citizenship. For contesting elections from a state Legislative Assembly Constituency, the intending candidate should be enrolled in the electoral roll of any assembly constituency in that state. The presumption in normal course would be that such person is a citizen. In case somebody challenges the citizenship of a candidate, the onus is on the objector to produce sufficient proof before the RO in this regard. If this onus is discharged by the objector, the RO should prima-facie give an opportunity to the intending candidate to rebut the complaint. Generally, MHA issues such certificate of canceling citizenship.
<br><br>Ques. 11. If illiterate proposer himself denies about his thumb impression, how RO can decide on thumb impression validity? Should he call finger print expert?
<br>Ans.    The illiterate person proposing a candidate has to put his thumb impression before the RO or an Administrative Officer not below the rank of SDO.

<br><br>Ques. 13. If during scrutiny, a proposer says on affidavit that he has not signed on nomination papers, then what will RO do?
<br>Ans.    The RO has to satisfy himself about the signature of the proposers. In case he is satisfied after summary enquiry that the signature is not of the proposer as claimed by him then the nomination paper shall be rejected for want of required number of proposers and the person who filed the nomination paper with forged signature/thumb impression will have to be prosecuted under the law. However, the candidate concerned should be given adequate opportunity to present his case. If necessary, scrutiny proceedings in that candidates€ case can be adjourned.

It should be noted that oath can be taken only after the nomination paper is filed. It would be for the candidate to produce before the RO, the certificate of taking of oath as per the requirement of law.

There are various aspects that need to be looked into before calling a news item a suspected case of “Paid News”, like bias, undue favour, reads more like propaganda than news item, consistently one- sided, factually incorrect and in favour of a particular candidate in continuous opposition to another candidate etc. The MCMC has to apply its mind collectively to decide on each such cases based on samples & evidences. One news report of a criticism of a political adversary need not constitute “Paid News”.
