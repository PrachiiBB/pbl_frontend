In exceptional circumstances, MPs and MLAs may be permitted by the Commission to vote at other State Capitals also.
<br><br>Q.15    What is the colour and form of ballot papers used in the election to the office of the President?

The  ballot papers are printed with two columns-first column containing the names of the candidates and the second column for marking preferences by the elector for each such candidate. The ballot papers are printed in Hindi and English for use by MPs and in the official language(s) of the State and in English for use by the MLAs of the State concerned. [see Rule 10 of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Rules, 1974]
<br><br>Q.16    Is the value of vote of each elector the same?
<br>Answer: No. The value of votes of MLAs would differ from State to State as the value of each such vote is calculated by the process explained below. However, the value of votes of all MPs is the same.
<br><br>Q.17    How is the value of votes of members of the Electoral College calculated?
Under the Constitution of India, there shall always be a President of India (See Article 52 of the Constitution).

<br>Answer: No. The value of votes of MLAs would differ from State to State as the value of each such vote is calculated by the process explained below. However, the value of votes of all MPs is the same.
<br><br>Q.17    How is the value of votes of members of the Electoral College calculated?
<br>Answer: The value of votes of electors is basically determined on the basis of population of the States in accordance with the manner laid down in Article 55(2)
 
of the Constitution. The Constitution (Eighty-fourth Amendment) Act, 2001 provides that until the population figures for the first census to be taken after the year 2026 have been published, the population of the States for the purposes of calculation of  value of the votes for  the  Presidential Election shall mean the population as ascertained at the 1971 census. The value of the vote of each member of a State Legislative Assembly included in the Electoral College is calculated by dividing the population of the State concerned (as per 1971 Census) by the total number of elected members of the Assembly, and then further dividing the quotient by 1000. If the remainder, while so dividing is 500 or more, then the value is increased by Ǯ1ǯ. Total Value of votes of all members of each State Assembly is worked out by multiplying the number of elective seats in the Assembly by the number of votes for each member in the respective State. The total value of votes of all the States worked out as above in respect of each State and added together is divided by the total number of elected members of Parliament (Lok Sabha 543+Rajya Sabha 233) to get the value of votes of each Member of Parliament. The statement of Value of Votes of MLAs & MPs as per Article 55(2) of the Constitution is given below*. (Appendix)
<br><br>Q.18    What is the manner/procedure for recording votes at an election to the office of President?
<br>Answer: In accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote, every elector can mark as many preferences, as there are candidates contesting the election. These preferences for the candidates are to be marked by the elector, by placing the figures 1,2,3, 4, 5 and so on, against the names of the candidates, in the order of preference, in the space provided in column 2 of the ballot paper. The preferences can be indicated in international form of Indian numerals or in the form used in any Indian language or in Roman form but the preferences cannot be indicated in words like one, two, first preference second preference etc. [see Rule 17 of the Presidential and Vice- Presidential Rules, 1974].
 
<br><br>Q.19    Is it compulsory for an elector at a Presidential election to mark his preference for all candidates?
<br>Answer: No. Only the marking of first preference is compulsory for a ballot paper to be valid. Marking other preferences is optional.
<br><br>Q.20    Are the provisions of the Anti-Defection Law applicable in Presidential elections?
<br>Answer: No. Members of the Electoral College can vote according to their wish and are not bound by any party whips. The voting is by secret ballot. Therefore, Party whip does not apply in this election.
<br><br>Q.21    Are Nominated Members of either Houses of Parliament or a State Legislative Assembly eligible to vote at the election to the Office of President?
<br>Answer:No. Only elected members of both Houses of Parliament and of the State Legislative Assemblies are members of the Electoral College for Presidential Election. Therefore, nominated members cannot vote in this election. [see Article 54 of the Constitution.]
<br><br>Q.22    Can an elector at a Presidential election exercise his vote by proxy?
<br>Answer: No.
<br><br>Q.23    Whether provisions of NOTA are applicable?
<br>Answer: No.
<br><br>Q.24    Can a disabled or illiterate elector in a Presidential election take the help of a companion to record his vote?
<br>Answer: No. Unlike in Parliamentary and Assembly election, an elector cannot take the help of a companion. He can take only the assistance of the Presiding Officer to record his vote, if he is unable to read the ballot paper or to record his vote by reason of his illiteracy or blindness or any physical or other disabilities. The Presiding Officer is obliged under the rule to record the vote according to the  wishes of the elector and keep such vote secret. [see Rule 19 of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Rules, 1974].
<br><br>Q.25    How can an elector who is under preventive detention during the period of Presidential election cast his vote?
<br>Answer: An elector under preventive detention can cast his vote through postal ballot, which will be sent to him by the Election Commission on the place of his detention. [see Rule 26 of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Rules, 1974].
<br><br>Q.26    Is the winner in a Presidential election elected on the basis of obtaining simple majority? Or by securing a specified quota of votes?
<br>Answer: As the Presidential election is held in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote, every elector has as many preferences as candidates contesting the elections. The winning candidate has to secure the required quota of votes to be declared elected, i.e., 50% of valid votes polled +1. [see the schedule of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Rules, 1974].
<br><br>Q.27    What are the grounds for rejection of the ballot papers?
<br>Answer: The Returning Officer shall reject a ballot paper as invalid on which:
<br>1.    The figure 1 is not marked; or
<br>2.    The figure 1 is marked against the name of more than one candidate or is marked in a manner which renders it doubtful as to which candidate it is intended to apply; or
<br>3.    The figure 1 and some other figure is marked against the name of the same candidate; or
<br>4.    Any mark is made by which the elector may be identified.
A ballot paper will also be invalidated if the preference is marked in words like one, two, three or first preference, second preference, third preference, etc., instead of in figures 1, 2, 3 etc. A postal ballot may be rejected if the signature of
the elector on the declaration and the attestation form received with the ballot
 
paper is not duly attested by the authority specified in such form (who is normally the officer-in-charge of the jail or the place of detention). [see rule 31 of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Rules, 1974].

<br><br>Q.28    What is the procedure of counting in a Presidential election? How is the quota of votes to be secured by the winning candidate determined?
<br>Answer: After the valid ballot papers are segregated from the invalid ones, the valid ballot papers are distributed among the contesting candidates on the basis of first preference marked on each of them for those candidates. The value of votes which each contesting candidate gets in this process is ascertained by multiplying the number of ballot papers on which the first preference is marked for him, by the value of vote which each ballot paper of a member (MP or MLA) represents as indicated on the ballot paper itself. The total votes secured by each contesting candidate are then ascertained by adding together the value of votes secured by him from the Members of Parliament and the Members of the State Legislative Assemblies. This is the first round of counting.
For ascertaining the quota sufficient to secure the return of a candidate, the value of votes credited to each contesting candidate in the first round of counting is added up to determine the total value of valid votes polled at the election. Such total value of valid votes is then divided by two, and one is added to the quotient so obtained, ignoring the remainder, if any. The number so determined, is the quota, which a candidate should secure to be declared elected.
If the total value of the votes credited to any candidate at the first count, is equal to, or greater than, the quota sufficient to secure the return of a candidate, that candidate is declared elected by the Returning Officer. If, however, after the first round of counting, no candidate secures the requisite quota, then the counting proceeds on the basis of a process of elimination and exclusion, whereby the candidate credited with the lowest number of votes is excluded and all his ballot papers are distributed among the remaining (continuing) candidates on the basis  of  the  second  preferences  marked,  if  any,  thereon.  The  value  of  such
 
transferred ballot papers will be the same as the value at which the excluded candidate received them. The ballot papers on which second preference is not marked is treated as exhausted ballot papers and shall not be further counted, even if the third or subsequent preferences are marked thereon. If no candidate secures the requisite quota even at this stage after distribution of votes of the excluded candidate then the process of counting will continue on the same basis of elimination and exclusion of the candidate with lowest vote till a candidate secures the required quota of votes. In case, even after the exclusion of the candidates receiving the lowest number of votes, no candidate secures the requisite quota and ultimately one candidate remains as the lone continuing candidate, he is declared elected even if he has failed to secure the quota sufficient to secure the return of a candidate. [see the schedule to the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Rules, 1974].
<br><br>Q.29    Where is the counting of votes in a Presidential election held?
<br>Answer: The counting of votes is done in the office of the Returning officer at New Delhi.
<br><br>Q.30    When is the security deposit of a candidate in a Presidential Election forfeited?
<br>Answer: The Security deposit shall be forfeited if the candidate is not elected and the number of valid votes polled by him does not exceed one-sixth of the number of votes necessary to secure return of a candidate at such election. In other cases, the deposit will be returned to the candidate. The security deposit is returned by ECI. [see Section 20A of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Act, 1952].
<br><br>Q.31    Can the result of the election to the Office of President be challenged? If so, what is the proper procedure for doing so?
<br>Answer: Yes. An election to the Office of the President can be called in question by means of an election petition presented to the Supreme Court after the election is over. Such election petition should be presented by a candidate or twenty or more electors joined together as petitioners, and may be presented at any time after the date of publication of the declaration containing the name of the returned candidate at the election under Section 12 (of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952), but not later than 30 days from the date of such publication. Subject to these provisions, the Supreme Court, under Article 145 of the Constitution, may regulate the form, manner and the procedures connected with such election petitions. [see Sections 13 to 20 of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Act, 1952].

Answer: The value of votes of electors is basically determined on the basis of population of the States in accordance with the manner laid down in Article 55(2)
 
of the Constitution. The Constitution (Eighty-fourth Amendment) Act, 2001 provides that until the population figures for the first census to be taken after the year 2026 have been published, the population of the States for the purposes of calculation of  value of the votes for  the  Presidential Election shall mean the population as ascertained at the 1971 census. The value of the vote of each member of a State Legislative Assembly included in the Electoral College is calculated by dividing the population of the State concerned (as per 1971 Census) by the total number of elected members of the Assembly, and then further dividing the quotient by 1000. If the remainder, while so dividing is 500 or more, then the value is increased by Ǯ1ǯ. Total Value of votes of all members of each State Assembly is worked out by multiplying the number of elective seats in the Assembly by the number of votes for each member in the respective State. The total value of votes of all the States worked out as above in respect of each State and added together is divided by the total number of elected members of Parliament (Lok Sabha 543+Rajya Sabha 233) to get the value of votes of each Member of Parliament. The statement of Value of Votes of MLAs & MPs as per Article 55(2) of the Constitution is given below*. (Appendix)
<br><br>Q.18    What is the manner/procedure for recording votes at an election to the office of President?
<br>Answer: In accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of single transferable vote, every elector can mark as many preferences, as there are candidates contesting the election. These preferences for the candidates are to be marked by the elector, by placing the figures 1,2,3, 4, 5 and so on, against the names of the candidates, in the order of preference, in the space provided in column 2 of the ballot paper. The preferences can be indicated in international form of Indian numerals or in the form used in any Indian language or in Roman form but the preferences cannot be indicated in words like one, two, first preference second preference etc. [see Rule 17 of the Presidential and Vice- Presidential Rules, 1974].
 
<br><br>Q.19    Is it compulsory for an elector at a Presidential election to mark his preference for all candidates?
<br>Answer: No. Only the marking of first preference is compulsory for a ballot paper to be valid. Marking other preferences is optional.
<br><br>Q.20    Are the provisions of the Anti-Defection Law applicable in Presidential elections?
<br>Answer: No. Members of the Electoral College can vote according to their wish and are not bound by any party whips. The voting is by secret ballot. Therefore, Party whip does not apply in this election.
<br><br>Q.21    Are Nominated Members of either Houses of Parliament or a State Legislative Assembly eligible to vote at the election to the Office of President?
<br>Answer:No. Only elected members of both Houses of Parliament and of the State Legislative Assemblies are members of the Electoral College for Presidential Election. Therefore, nominated members cannot vote in this election. [see Article 54 of the Constitution.]
<br><br>Q.22    Can an elector at a Presidential election exercise his vote by proxy?
<br>Answer: No.
<br><br>Q.23    Whether provisions of NOTA are applicable?
<br>Answer: No.
<br><br>Q.24    Can a disabled or illiterate elector in a Presidential election take the help of a companion to record his vote?
<br>Answer: No. Unlike in Parliamentary and Assembly election, an elector cannot take the help of a companion. He can take only the assistance of the Presiding Officer to record his vote, if he is unable to read the ballot paper or to record his vote by reason of his illiteracy or blindness or any physical or other disabilities. The Presiding Officer is obliged under the rule to record the vote according to the  wishes of the elector and keep such vote secret. [see Rule 19 of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Rules, 1974].
<br><br>Q.25    How can an elector who is under preventive detention during the period of Presidential election cast his vote?
<br>Answer: An elector under preventive detention can cast his vote through postal ballot, which will be sent to him by the Election Commission on the place of his detention. [see Rule 26 of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Rules, 1974].
<br><br>Q.26    Is the winner in a Presidential election elected on the basis of obtaining simple majority? Or by securing a specified quota of votes?
<br>Answer: As the Presidential election is held in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote, every elector has as many preferences as candidates contesting the elections. The winning candidate has to secure the required quota of votes to be declared elected, i.e., 50% of valid votes polled +1. [see the schedule of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Rules, 1974].
<br><br>Q.27    What are the grounds for rejection of the ballot papers?
<br>Answer: The Returning Officer shall reject a ballot paper as invalid on which:
<br>1.    The figure 1 is not marked; or
<br>2.    The figure 1 is marked against the name of more than one candidate or is marked in a manner which renders it doubtful as to which candidate it is intended to apply; or
<br>3.    The figure 1 and some other figure is marked against the name of the same candidate; or
<br>4.    Any mark is made by which the elector may be identified.
A ballot paper will also be invalidated if the preference is marked in words like one, two, three or first preference, second preference, third preference, etc., instead of in figures 1, 2, 3 etc. A postal ballot may be rejected if the signature of
the elector on the declaration and the attestation form received with the ballot
 
paper is not duly attested by the authority specified in such form (who is normally the officer-in-charge of the jail or the place of detention). [see rule 31 of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Rules, 1974].

<br><br>Q.28    What is the procedure of counting in a Presidential election? How is the quota of votes to be secured by the winning candidate determined?
<br>Answer: After the valid ballot papers are segregated from the invalid ones, the valid ballot papers are distributed among the contesting candidates on the basis of first preference marked on each of them for those candidates. The value of votes which each contesting candidate gets in this process is ascertained by multiplying the number of ballot papers on which the first preference is marked for him, by the value of vote which each ballot paper of a member (MP or MLA) represents as indicated on the ballot paper itself. The total votes secured by each contesting candidate are then ascertained by adding together the value of votes secured by him from the Members of Parliament and the Members of the State Legislative Assemblies. This is the first round of counting.
For ascertaining the quota sufficient to secure the return of a candidate, the value of votes credited to each contesting candidate in the first round of counting is added up to determine the total value of valid votes polled at the election. Such total value of valid votes is then divided by two, and one is added to the quotient so obtained, ignoring the remainder, if any. The number so determined, is the quota, which a candidate should secure to be declared elected.
If the total value of the votes credited to any candidate at the first count, is equal to, or greater than, the quota sufficient to secure the return of a candidate, that candidate is declared elected by the Returning Officer. If, however, after the first round of counting, no candidate secures the requisite quota, then the counting proceeds on the basis of a process of elimination and exclusion, whereby the candidate credited with the lowest number of votes is excluded and all his ballot papers are distributed among the remaining (continuing) candidates on the basis  of  the  second  preferences  marked,  if  any,  thereon.  The  value  of  such
 
transferred ballot papers will be the same as the value at which the excluded candidate received them. The ballot papers on which second preference is not marked is treated as exhausted ballot papers and shall not be further counted, even if the third or subsequent preferences are marked thereon. If no candidate secures the requisite quota even at this stage after distribution of votes of the excluded candidate then the process of counting will continue on the same basis of elimination and exclusion of the candidate with lowest vote till a candidate secures the required quota of votes. In case, even after the exclusion of the candidates receiving the lowest number of votes, no candidate secures the requisite quota and ultimately one candidate remains as the lone continuing candidate, he is declared elected even if he has failed to secure the quota sufficient to secure the return of a candidate. [see the schedule to the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Rules, 1974].
<br><br>Q.29    Where is the counting of votes in a Presidential election held?
<br>Answer: The counting of votes is done in the office of the Returning officer at New Delhi.
<br><br>Q.30    When is the security deposit of a candidate in a Presidential Election forfeited?
<br>Answer: The Security deposit shall be forfeited if the candidate is not elected and the number of valid votes polled by him does not exceed one-sixth of the number of votes necessary to secure return of a candidate at such election. In other cases, the deposit will be returned to the candidate. The security deposit is returned by ECI. [see Section 20A of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Act, 1952].
<br><br>Q.31    Can the result of the election to the Office of President be challenged? If so, what is the proper procedure for doing so?
<br>Answer: Yes. An election to the Office of the President can be called in question by means of an election petition presented to the Supreme Court after the election is over. Such election petition should be presented by a candidate or twenty or more electors joined together as petitioners, and may be presented at any time after the date of publication of the declaration containing the name of the returned candidate at the election under Section 12 (of the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952), but not later than 30 days from the date of such publication.
